            <p>This platform may be inspired by some of my life, but this isn't about me.
              Hence, I didn't call this the about me section. But, while we're at it...
              I've always wanted to share what I imagine once I was comforable enough
              in my own niche to back my imagination. Well time's-a'tick'n!
              </p>
            <p> Once you feel like you've rounded
              yourself enough in the areas to be an efficient team member, put yourself in places with other people ready to
              showcase their work as well.
              </p>
            <p>Leaving the times of when time was abundant, but still of the essence, I want to give people another outlet to display their creativity alongside other builders. Productivity and dreams are no longer so far apart avec les autres gens
              seeking memorable experiences.
              </p>
            <p>Creating alone is necessary at times, especially in the early-learning phases. Still-yet, the more expereinced we become, the more passionate we grow about sharing what we've made rather than just having the satisfaction of knowing that we're able to do it.
